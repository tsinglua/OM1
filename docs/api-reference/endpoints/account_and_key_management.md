Your OpenMind account and API keys are used for authentication and authorization in your applications. You can manage your account and keys via the [OpenMind portal](https://portal.openmind.com) or directly via an API. The API provides access to the full set of operations (generate, delete, account balance, and key listing).

**Base URL:** `https://api.openmind.com/api/core`

**Authentication:** All endpoints require a JWT token generated with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). Include the token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

## Endpoints Overview

| GET | `/account/balance` | Get your account balance |
| GET | `/api_keys` | List all API keys |

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using a JWT token issued by Clerk. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Getting Your JWT Token

You can obtain your JWT token through:
1. **OpenMind Portal:** Log in at [portal.openmind.com](https://portal.openmind.com) and copy your session token
2. **Clerk SDK:** Use the Clerk client library to authenticate and retrieve the session token programmatically

### Example with Token

```bash
# Set your token as an environment variable
export OPENMIND_JWT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."

# Use it in your requests
curl -X GET https://api.openmind.com/api/core/account/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENMIND_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow consistent error response patterns:

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid input parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Missing or invalid JWT token |
| 403 | Forbidden - Action not allowed (e.g., rate limit reached) |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Server-side error |

### Error Response Format

```json

  "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

## Rate Limits

API key operations may be subject to rate limits depending on your subscription plan. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
